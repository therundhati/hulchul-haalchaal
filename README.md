### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with `dist` directory. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

Clone the source files of the theme and navigate into the theme's root directory. Run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `package.json` file to see which scripts are included.

### Contact Form

closing `</body>` tag to SB Forms.
